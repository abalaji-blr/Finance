# About Crypto Currencies

Crypto is a **digital** (electronic) currency implemented using **block chain** (also known as **distributed ledger**) technology. It's also a **de-centralised** currency, which means no government can influence over it. It can be purchased in **fractions** (ie., divisible). They are traded in the crypto exchanges **24/7** unlike stocks in the equity market. Given that the cryptos are in the nascent stage, they are very **volatile**.

Popular Crypto Currencies (aka **coins or tokens**) are:

* Bitcoin
* Ether



## How is crypto coin represented?

The crypto coin (aka token) is represented as **public** and **private** key. Each key is a 64 bit Hexa decimal code. As name suggests, the public key is visible to all. To operate / transact, one need to know the private key.

When you buy coins / tokens through crypto exchanges, you will store them in **wallet**. Hence, you don't need to deal with **public and private keys** per se. The **wallet** stores the collection of these keys.

All these crypto tokens are stored in **block chain**.

## Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoins are available only in limited quantity. Thus it's used as **value** store. Currently (as of Sep/2021), there are 18.5M bitcoins in circulation against the capped limit of 21M.

The Bitcoin network uses **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) such as SHA-256**.

This is the **first generation crypto currency**, which is a value store (aka digital gold), which **can be transacted** between different parties.

## Ether (ETH)

Ethereum is a platform (**block chain**) which uses **Ether** as the digital money but also can run **decentralised applications** (dApps). These **decentralised applications** are also called as **smart contract**.

This is the **second generation of crypto currency**, which can be **transacted** between parties on  **certain conditions**. The conditions are **programmed** and they are called as in general as **smart contract**.

### What is ERC20?

ERC20 stands for **Ethereum Request for Comment-20** is a standard created for interoperability of tokens created using Ethereum network. There are many popular tokens which confirms to **ERC20** .



## Cardano (ADA)

Cardano is **3rd generation of crypto currency**, which tries to solve the bottle-necks with Ethereum. Incidentally, one of **co-founder of the Ethereum - Chrales Hoskinson, is the co-founder for Cardano as well**.

It tries to address - **scalabilty( transactions-per-second, data, network), interoperability( to work with different block-chains like bitcoin-block-chain, ethereum-block-chain etc), and sustainability**.

## Polygon (MATIC)

Polygon (Previously called as Matic Network) Technology is trying to address the issue of **inter-operability** (to work with multiple block-chains) **for the Ethereum**. They have a notion of **side-chain** to address that.

**Polygon** is a protocol and framework for building and connecting **Ethereum compatible** blockchain networks. It's **native token is called, MATIC**.

The following other companies also address the multi chain system are : **Polkadot, Cosmos and Avalanche**.

## Ripple (XRP)

Ripple is **NOT** block chain based. It's meant for larger companies and corporations.
